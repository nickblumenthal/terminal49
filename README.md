Some notes:

There are plenty of things left to do to improve on this app given more time.


- [ ] Way more specs
- [x] Handle errors on login/signup ajax requests
- [ ] Improved styling
- [ ] Refactor out several components from Header.jsx
- [ ] Refactor error handling logic in login/signup forms
- [ ] Improved efficiency when returning logged in user so there isn't a second call for search history
- [ ] Display save/remove button only when logged in
- [ ] Many others...


Some known issues related to the above

- You have to be logged in to save a booking even though it presents the option
- There is no feedback or error states for bad login attempts or already taken users
